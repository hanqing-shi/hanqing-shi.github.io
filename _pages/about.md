I'm currently a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at the **University of California, Berkeley**, specializing in control of robotic and autonomous systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering from the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China** (UESTC). My interests focus primarily on robotics, with experience in robot manipulation, embodied AI, sim-to-real transfer, reinforcement learning, and image processing.
